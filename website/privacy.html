  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 5, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Welcome to Buy European ("we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how we handle your data. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("App"). By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, or retain any personal or identifiable user data. The App operates in real-time and does not save any scanned data, user interactions, or analytics.</p>

  <h3>a. Camera and Barcode Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The App requires access to your device’s camera to scan barcodes for product identification.</li>
    <li>The scanned barcode is processed in real time and is not saved on your device or our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>b. Third-Party API Requests</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open Food Facts:</strong> When you scan a barcode, the App queries the Open Food Facts database to retrieve product information. No personal data is sent or stored.</li>
    <li><strong>Gemini AI:</strong> To determine the country of origin of the manufacturer, we utilize Gemini AI. Only barcode data and necessary product details are transmitted, without any user-identifiable information.</li>
    <li>The handling of data by these third-party services is subject to their respective privacy policies. We encourage you to review their policies for further details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the scanned barcode data solely for the purpose of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identifying product information from Open Food Facts.</li>
    <li>Determining whether the product originates from a European country using Gemini AI.</li>
    <li>Displaying the results to the user in real-time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Since no user data is stored or retained, we do not use your information for any additional purposes, such as analytics, marketing, or advertising.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not collect or share any personally identifiable information. However, barcode data is temporarily transmitted to third-party services (Open Food Facts and Gemini AI) for processing. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.</p>
  <p>We will only disclose information if required by law or in response to a valid legal request.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the integrity and security of our App. However, since no user data is stored, the risk of unauthorized access, alteration, or misuse of data is minimized.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We do not store any user data. All barcode scans are processed in real-time and discarded immediately after displaying results.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided personal information, please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.</p>

  <h2>8. Compliance with GDPR (DSGVO)</h2>
  <p>As our App does not collect or store personal data, we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO) by ensuring that user privacy is protected by design. If you have any questions about your data rights, feel free to contact us.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
